# What we have done ?

We have created a form to simulate the real-time data and feed into the recommender system. The Recommender.java will recommend speed based on severity values calculated as part of SevCalculator.java. The sparql is done in SparqlQuery.java.
The resources folder has the Accidents.owl file.
